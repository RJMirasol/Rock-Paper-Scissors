// Problem - Creating a rock, paper scissors game using JS

//Plan
//1.Does the program have UI & what it lools like? Not at the moment (will be in the future)
//2.What inputs will your program have? Users input via prompt and computers using a function
//3.What's the desired output? Either user or computer wins and output it on the console
//Given your inputs, what are the steps necessaty to return the desired output? Follow the pseudocode

//Pseudocode
//Get the computers selection using a function
// --Use math.random to get random numbers and make sure to convert to whole number and save it as a variable
// --Use conditional if statement for rock = 1, paper = 2, scissors = 3
// --Return the computer selection

//Get the users selection using prompt --Save the users input into the a variable

//Create a function to Compare computer's and user's input using conditional if statement
//Output the results via console log
